- Plexiglass plate da 5mm
- 21 piezo
- 76 bolts M3
- 4 bolts M5
- 42 rubber bands
- any elastic material (the more compact the better) 940mm x 80mm x ~5mm (l, w, h)
- 42 spacers 5mm
- 42 o-ring
- 52 nuts M3
- 26 led 5mm
- 26 resistors 330ohm
- 21 resistors 1Mohm
- 5 switches 2 states 6mm
- 2 Arduino MEGA
- 1 Sparkfun DEV-12898

1) Glue the elastic material to the wooden beam
2) Glue the piezos to the elastic material, solder together all the GNDs and solder the 1Mohm resistors for each positive cable of the piezos (see wiring diagram)
3) Solder one wire to each resistor and run it all the way to the far left where the control panel will be
4) Solder the LEDs and the 330ohm resistors for each one on a perfboard
5) Glue the perfboard behind the base of the keys
6) Cut the plexiglas pieces as per the .dwg file and in the right quantity
7) Fix the Plexiglas base to the walls with the M3 bolts
8) Insert bolts into the walls with 1 spacer and 1 nut each
9) Glue the o-rings in their positions and place the keys on them
10) Secure the frets with rubber bands to the spacers, passing the rubber band through the 3mm holes on the frets
11) Insert the wooden beam from underneath and screw in all the wall screws all the way down
12) Build the control panel box as per the template
13) Fix the 5 remaining LEDs with their resistors on the control panel cover
14) Fix the 5 switxhes on the control panel cover
15) Fix the 2 Arduino MEGA to the base and insert the MIDI sheld in the one on the left
16) Connect all cables according to the wiring diagram
17) Load the pianolaUNO program on the Arduino board with the MIDI shield and the pianolaDUE program on the other Arduino
18) Connect a MIDI-USB adapter to the shield and to the computer
19) Power the Arduino board with the MIDI sheld with a power supply
